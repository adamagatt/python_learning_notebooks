    "* Because generators can only be iterated over once, it is best practice to use them as soon as possible after their creation. You might not even need to create them as a variable, but instead use the generator expression or generator function call in-line with the code that consumes it. A generator that is created and then sits unused for a long time has a greater chance of accidentally being iterated over twice as its disposable nature becomes forgotten by the coder.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Lazy evaluation\n",
    "In general programming, Lazy Evaluation is an approach that comes in useful when you need to process a sequence of elements, and that processing involves multiple expensive steps. Traditional imperative programming conventionally uses \"eager evaluation\", where each step will process the entire sequence, storing the intermediate results in new variables. This comes with some costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Intermediate variables must be large enough to hold the results for the entire sequence.\n",
    "*   No results are available until the final step is processed, i.e. all operations have been performed on the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, lazy evaluation is an approach where we define how the calculations should be performed, without performing them just yet. Instead we construct a model of these step processes, and at the end the entire model is evaluated on the input data all at once. When the input is a sequence, we can apply the entire model to each element in turn, similar to stream processing. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intermediate variables only need enough memory to hold results for a single element at a time\n",
    "* The results from each element are made available as soon as they are computed (allowing for immediate display, writing to file, used for HTTP request, etc)\n",

It halts processing entirely until input is provided from \"system in\" (in this case, the keyboard). `name_stream` is a generator that will provide four names, but only provide each when requested. If it were a list comprehension, we would need to enter all four names before any further processing could proceed.
