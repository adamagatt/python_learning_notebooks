These are a series of Jupyter notebooks intended to provide an introduction to the Python programming language. These notebooks cover the syntax and fundamentals of the language, covering topics in a logical ordering and an in-depth manner.

These notebooks aim to "show, not just tell" by providing extensive usage examples and highlighting common errors or gotchas that might be encountered. Explanations are presented alongside code snippets that can be executed and modified to allow for rapid interactive learning.

The material is ideally aimed at learners who are coming to Python from another language, or to data scientists that might already use Python but would like a deeper understanding of program development.
